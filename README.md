# Toc Bar

A user script that adds floating widget displaying table of content of current page.

Currently only tailored for some popular sites. Feel free to tweak the settings or open a PR.

## âœ¨Features

- Use [tocbot](https://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot) for toc generation.
- For some sites, there is no id on header elements so it would be impossible to navigate by clicking the toc link. Toc Bar will generate ids - which are derived from a simple hash of the header textContent, and prefixed with `tocbar-` - for these headers.
